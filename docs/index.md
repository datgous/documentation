# Welcome to the Witnet ecosystem!

![alt medium |>][apis-illustration]{ align=right }

The Witnet protocol enables a network of computers to act as a
**decentralized oracle** that retrieves, attests and delivers
information on behalf of **smart contracts** in a **tamper-resistant**
way.

> This _Decentralized Oracle Network (DON)_ maintains and distributes a
> _block chain_ data structure that serves as a common ledger for the
> operation of the protocol as well as for the _wit_ token, which 
> incentivizes network players to abide by the protocol
> and makes them liable for any misbehavior. â€”
> [Witnet Whitepaper][whitepaper]

Active network participants **earn wit tokens** for fulfilling the data
retrieval, attestation and delivery tasks coming from different smart
contract platforms such as [Ethereum][ethereum].

## Node operators, a.k.a. *Witnesses*
The Witnet blockchain is free, open, and neutral. That is,
**[You can run your own node][run-a-node] and mine blocks on the Witnet
blockchain**. Every node maintains the history of all the transactions
on the blockchain.

Additionally, every node in the Witnet network can participate in
*witnessing*, i.e. **earning wit tokens in exchange of retrieving,
aggregating and delivering data points** from public APIs into smart
contracts.

## Developers

The Witnet ecosystem welcomes developers of all kind of backgrounds:
from people who contribute to [Witnet-Rust] or [Sheikah] to those who
want to
[connect their Ethereum smart contracts to external APIs][ethereum].
Developers can:

- Build Witnet clients.
- Build applications to interact with a Witnet client.
- Write [Ethereum smart contracts that use Witnet][ethereum], e.g.
  integrate Witnet into DeFi protocols.
- Build bridges between Witnet and other blockchains, so that contracts
  in those networks can query the Witnet decentralized oracle.
- Contribute to [Witnet-Rust] or [Sheikah].

## Witnet Foundation

[Witnet Foundation] is a non-profit dedicated to stewarding the
advancement of the Witnet oracle protocol and ecosystem, as well as
the broader Web3 space, with a focus on fostering research and development
of technologies that enhance the decentralization of communications and
financial infrastructure in search of more freedom for the individual.

Witnet Foundation is directly in charge of the development of Witnet-Rust,
as well as nurturing and funding an engaged and diverse ecosystem around
the Witnet protocol.

## Other significant actors in the development community

Beyond Witnet Foundation, there are other corporations and individuals
who contribute significantly to key parts of the ecosystem:

- [OtherPlane Labs], the software development startup now in charge of
  the development of the [Sheikah witnet wallet][sheikah].

- Dr. CPU, the anonymous developer (or developers) who built and
  operates the [Witnet Block Explorer].

The Witnet community is open to everyone. Even if you are not a
developer or node operator, there are
[many ways to get involved][contributing]!
